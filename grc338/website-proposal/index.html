            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Palm of Your Hand</p>
            
            <p>Palm of Your Hand is a small, neighborhood plant shop giving people the means to start their own garden. They offer seed packets and pre-potted plants for customers to start or expand their home gardens. The company encourages a green lifestyle and the incorporation of nature into the living space.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience for the products at Palm of Your Hand are people in the age range of 25-65, preferably with a knack for home decorating or garden care. The site would not be catering to any specific gender as anyone can have the desire to garden.</p>
           
            <p>Additionally, people who spend a good deal of time at home would benefit from the products offered in-store. Single individuals looking to fill their time by caring for something that does not need as much attention as a pet would probably like to purchase from Palm of Your Hand as well.</p>
